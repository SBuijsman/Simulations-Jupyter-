    "This document is first a series of two in which the Lorentz Force equation will be solved analytically for a homogeneous magnetic field. This seems trivial, but the solution will be found via an unusual approach. In this approach, a matrix formulation of the Lorentz Force equation will be determined, after which matrix exponentiation will be employed. The result will not be too surprising, but rather illuminating."

    "Here, $\\gamma$ is the relativistic gamma factor. One would think that, given that this is a function of $t$, this would complicate matters. However, since magnetic fields cannot perform work, the particle's speed (magnitude of the velocity vector) never increases. Since $\\gamma$ only depends on this speed, it is constant in time. The expression can then be written as\n",
