    "This document is second a series of two in which the Lorentz Force equation will be solved analytically for a homogeneous magnetic field. In the previous document, the solution was found in terms of a two-dimensional rotation matrix. In this document this notion will be generalised to three dimensions. It will not provide that much more insight, but it will be a useful result when studying three-dimensional motion of particles through magnetic fields."
